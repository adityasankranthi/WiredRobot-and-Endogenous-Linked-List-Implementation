The goal of this assignment is to implement an "endogenous" linked list and to apply it in the construction of a new type of robot, the WiredRobot. The assignment also includes implementing the insertion sort algorithm for sorting the robot's parts, making this one of the most efficient sorting methods for short or nearly sorted lists.
